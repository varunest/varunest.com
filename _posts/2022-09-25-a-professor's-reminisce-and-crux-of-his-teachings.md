Book review of "[The last lecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611510-the-last-lecture){:target="_blank"}" by Randy Pausch. A professor gets to know he has several months to live and decides to give a lecture at Carnegie Mellon to leave a legacy and commemorate his profession as a teacher. 

<!--break-->

The recording of the lecture is [available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&t=3873s&ab_channel=CarnegieMellonUniversity){:target="_blank"} as well, if you can't take out time to read the book, I would recommend watching the 1.5hr lecture. 

Book has 61 chapters, each chapter is advice by Randy that he believed in and adhered to. After ruminating Randy decides to spend a significant time of his remaining life preparing and delivering this lecture. He did so to leave a legacy and teachings for his children who were all of a very small age at the time. 

While reading there were several occasions when I was teary-eyed. His way of living and his accomplishments is something to look up to. The way he articulated and summarized ideas that just pierce through is impressive. 

This book has a lot to offer. Leaving some quotes that I found hard-hitting:

> When you see yourself doing something badly and nobody’s bothering to tell you anymore, that’s a bad place to be. You may not want to hear it, but your critics are often the ones telling you they still love you and care about you, and want to make you better

> Time must be explicitly managed, like money

> You can always change your plan, but only if you have one

> People will show you their good side. Almost everybody has a good side. Just keep waiting. It will come out.

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity

> Whether you think you can or can't, you're right

> If you want something bad enough, never give up. Brick walls are there to let you prove how badly you want something. 

> Sometimes, all you have to do is ask.

> Parent's job is to encourage kids to develop a joy for life and a great urge to follow their own dreams. The best we can do is to help them develop a personal set of tools for the task

> If you lead your life the right way, the karma will take care of itself. The dreams will come to you.
